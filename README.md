# Ultrasonic Distance Measurement System using 8051 Microcontroller

This project demonstrates a distance measurement system built around the **AT89C51 microcontroller** (8051 family) and the **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**. The system calculates the distance to an obstacle using the time-of-flight of ultrasonic waves and displays the output in centimeters on a **16x2 LCD**. 

This project was implemented as part of an academic exploration in **embedded systems and real-time sensor interfacing**.

## üî¨ Working Principle

1. **Trigger Pulse**: The 8051 sends a 10 ¬µs HIGH signal to the HC-SR04's TRIG pin.
2. **Echo Response**: The sensor emits an ultrasonic burst and sets the ECHO pin HIGH while waiting for the reflection.
3. **Timer Capture**: The 8051 uses Timer0 to measure the duration for which the ECHO pin remains HIGH.
4. **Distance Calculation**: Based on the speed of sound, the microcontroller computes:
